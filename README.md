# Openvino Notebooks and Scripts
A collection of some Jupyter notebooks and other python scripts to learn and experiment with the OpenVINOâ„¢ Toolkit.   
These applications have been tested for OpenVINO 2022.1 for Windows.   

Within this repository you can find:
+ `000-quantize_model`, an example to learn how to quantize a model with POT
+ `000-transfer_learning`, an example to learn how to re-train a model with Keras API
+ `001-hello-world`, an example to learn how to do inference with a classification IR model
+ `003-hello-segmentation`, an example to learn how to do inference with a segmentation IR model
+ `004-hello-detection`, an example to learn how to do inference with a text-detection IR model
+ `101-tensorflow-to-openvino`, an example to learn how to convert a TensorFlow model into IR model with MO
+ `102-pytorch-onnx-to-openvino`, an example to learn how to convert a PyTorch model into ONNX model and IR model
